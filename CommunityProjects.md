# Community Projects

The RO community has created numerous projects over the years. While many are of questionable practical use, some could still be of interest today.

## Third-Party Client Implementations

There have been countless attempts at creating a custom client to pair up with the existing server emulators. The following list is not exhaustive, but should contain all the most recent ones, particularly those that I've been following more closely:
